# SC-Clustering

### Worked with Sporting Cristal's academy division to bette group players based on their morphologic characteristics for nutrition and development purposes

#### Problem Statement:

The club is currently using anthropometric data from various academy and reserve team players to evaluate their performance in terms of different body composition variables, such as body fat mass, muscle mass, and sum of skinfolds.

The current methodology involves classifying and comparing players within the same age category, leading to potential biases and inaccuracies. For instance, a 15 year old player may be grouped with 18 years olds, despite significant differences in physical development. Height also plays a crucial role, as taller individuals naturally tend to hae higher muscle mass, for example.

Therefore, it is essential to come up a better classification/grouping system that accounts for both age and height of the players. By doing so, we aim to ensure that team analyses and assessments accurately reflect the players morphological and biological realities.

#### Our Approach
Employed k-means clustering to group players according to their key characteristics: Height and Age. Thus keeping the scope of the project two-dimensional for better explainability.
The goal was to uncover underlying patterns and structures within the unlabeled data and organize players based on their actual morphological similarities.

We opted for 5 and 6 clusters in our analysis. And recommended the decision makers to consult with profesional in the domain for a better evaluation of results.

We then proceeded to perform data analyses on the output, and confirmed that the variability of the data was significantly less, with a significant reduciton in standard deviation among groups that indicated a more compact and distinct clustering of players based on their characteritisc.
